		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>Hello! My name is Dan and I am an undergrad finance student at SNHU. I have a military background and have worked in several countries for the past four years. Web and Software Development has been an interest of mine for quite some time, and recently I decided it was time for a career change! I've chosen to participate in the Web Developer Bootcamp offered through Bloc and feel excited to meet others within the industry. Challenges and problem solving draw me in, and working with a team dedicated to completing projects and solving problems is exactly what I'm looking for. If you are looking for someone to assist in projects, please feel free to contact me!</p>
